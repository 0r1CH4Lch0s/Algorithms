In the 'Algorithms' folder, I provide examples of my own code facilitating working algorithms. All the code I have written is based on online courses and books I have read.

All the code is in the programming language 'Python'.

If you are unfamiliar with terms like "mergesort", "quicksort", and "split inversions", feel free to just google them for explanations of what they are.
